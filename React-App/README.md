## Purpose

The goal of this project is to showcase a robust and scalable frontend architecture that integrates with a backend API to perform CRUD operations. It is designed to highlight proficiency in React, TypeScript, and state management, as well as the ability to create responsive and user-friendly interfaces.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on data entities.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive UI for desktop and mobile devices.
- **State Management**: Efficient state handling using React's Context API or other state management libraries.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Strongly typed codebase for better maintainability and fewer runtime errors.
- **Fast Development**: Built with Vite for fast builds and hot module replacement (HMR).
- **Linting and Formatting**: Configured with ESLint and Prettier for consistent code quality.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript/TypeScript code.
- **Prettier**: A code formatter for consistent styling.
- **React Router**: For client-side routing and navigation.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
